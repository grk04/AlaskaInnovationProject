# DesignSimilarityDetector
Convolutional Neural Network model for customers to upload design preferences, automating design validation to ensure only high-confidence designs proceed to production 
Design Matcher is a project that compares two design photos using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It helps identify similarities between design images, which can be useful in various applications such as image matching, style verification, and pattern recognition.

Features
Compare two design photos and determine their similarity.
Simple and intuitive interface.
Easily customizable for different image sizes and types.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-matcher.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Ensure you have two design photos you want to compare.
Run the design_matcher.py script
python design_matcher.py


Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the paths to the design photos.
The script will output the similarity between the two design photos.

python design_matcher.py
Enter the path to the first design photo: /path/to/first/design/photo.jpg
Enter the path to the second design photo: /path/to/second/design/photo.jpg
Similarity between the two design photos: 0.85
